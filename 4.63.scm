;; The following data base (see Genesis 4) traces the genealogy of the descendants of Ada back to Adam, by way of Cain:
;;
;; (son Adam Cain)
;; (son Cain Enoch)
;; (son Enoch Irad)
;; (son Irad Mehujael)
;; (son Mehujael Methushael)
;; (son Methushael Lamech)
;; (wife Lamech Ada)
;; (son Ada Jabal)
;; (son Ada Jubal)
;;
;; Formulate rules such as "If S is the son of F, and F is the son of G, then S is the grandson of G" and "If W is the wife of M, and S is the son of W, then S is the son of M" (which was supposedly more true in biblical times than today) that will enable the query system to find the grandson of Cain; the sons of Lamech; the grandsons of Methushael. (See exercise 4.69 for some rules to deduce more complicated relationships.)
