## Question

Suppose we define the procedure

```scheme
(define (f g)
  (g 2))
```

Then we have

```scheme
(f square)
; 4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
; 6
```

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination `(f f)`? Explain.

## Answer

`(f f)` will fail trying to apply 2 to 2:

```scheme
(f f)
(f 2)
(2 2)
; The object 2 is not applicable.
```

The issue here is "typical": `f` expects `g` to b a *procedure*, not data. As MIT Scheme is dynamically typed, there is no method in the evalutor to check for parameter types: the programmer must construct their own methods, e.g.

```scheme
(define (f g)
  (if (procedure? g)
    (g 2)
    (error "NOT A PROCEDURE --" g)))
```
