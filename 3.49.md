## Question

Give a scenario where the deadlock-avoidance mechanism described above does not work. (Hint: In the exchange problem, each process knows in advance which accounts it will need to get access to. Consider a situation where a process must get access to some shared resources before it can know which additional shared resources it will require.)

## Answer

Any process that must access state before further computation -- a time-sensitive stock exchange, for instance -- will suffer from the possibility of deadlock.
