# 1.2

## Question

Translate the following expression into prefix form

$$
\frac{5 + 4 + (2 - (3 - (6 + \frac{4}{5})))}{3(6 - 2)(2 - 7)}
$$

## Answer

```scheme
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))))
   (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
```

The similarity in syntax between question and answer illustrate Scheme's bias toward mathematical expression, a.k.a. "expression-oriented"-ness.

Languages designed for a different "logic" (way of speaking) deploy differerent syntax.[^1]
