# 1.15

## Question

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $\sin x \approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$
\sin x = 3 \sin \frac{x}{3} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{x}{3}
$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $\sin$. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a. How many times is the procedure `p` applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of `a`) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?

## Answer

### a.

`p` is applied 5 times[^1].

### b.

`sine`'s order of operations (evaluating `sine` before `p`) generate a recursive process whose space and time complexity depend on the number of divisions by 3 required to yield an angle less than 0.1:

$$
\begin{align*}
\argmin_x & \{a \cdot (1/3)^x < 0.1\} \\[4pt]
\argmin_x & \{a \cdot 3^{-x} < 0.1\} \\[4pt]
\argmin_x & \{\log a - x \cdot \log 3 < \log 0.1\} \\[4pt]
\argmin_x & \{x \cdot \log 3 > \log a - \log 10\} \\[4pt]
\argmin_x & \{x > \frac{\log a - \log 10}{\log 3}\} \\[4pt]
\implies & \Theta(\log a).
\end{align*}
$$
