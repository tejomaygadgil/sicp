# 4.30

## Question

Cy D. Fect, a reformed C programmer, is worried that some side effects may never take place, because the lazy evaluator doesn't force the expressions in a sequence. Since the value of an expression in a sequence other than the last one is not used (the expression is there only for its effect, such as assigning to a variable or printing), there can be no subsequent use of this value (e.g., as an argument to a primitive procedure) that will cause it to be forced. Cy thus thinks that when evaluating sequences, we must force all expressions in the sequence except the final one. He proposes to modify `eval-sequence` from section 4.1.1 to use `actual-value` rather than `eval`:

```scheme
(define (eval-sequence exps env)
  (cond ((last-exp? exps) (eval (first-exp exps) env))
        (else (actual-value (first-exp exps) env)
              (eval-sequence (rest-exps exps) env))))
```

a. Ben Bitdiddle thinks Cy is wrong. He shows Cy the `for-each` procedure described in exercise 2.23, which gives an important example of a sequence with side effects:

```scheme
(define (for-each proc items)
  (if (null? items)
      'done
      (begin (proc (car items))
             (for-each proc (cdr items)))))
```

He claims that the evaluator in the text (with the original `eval-sequence`) handles this correctly:

```scheme
;;; L-Eval input:
(for-each (lambda (x) (newline) (display x))
          (list 57 321 88))
57
321
88
;;; L-Eval value:
done
```

Explain why Ben is right about the behavior of `for-each`.

b. Cy agrees that Ben is right about the `for-each` example, but says that that's not the kind of program he was thinking about when he proposed his change to `eval-sequence`. He defines the following two procedures in the lazy evaluator:

```scheme
(define (p1 x)
  (set! x (cons x '(2)))
  x)

(define (p2 x)
  (define (p e)
    e
    x)
  (p (set! x (cons x '(2)))))
```

What are the values of `(p1 1)` and `(p2 1)` with the original `eval-sequence`? What would the values be with Cy's proposed change to `eval-sequence`?

c. Cy also points out that changing `eval-sequence` as he proposes does not affect the behavior of the example in part a. Explain why this is true.

d. How do you think sequences ought to be treated in the lazy evaluator? Do you like Cy's approach, the approach in the text, or some other approach?

## Answer

### a.

Cy is mistaken. As all procedures are ultimately combinations of primitive procedures, `eval` will eventually send every application to `apply-primitive-procedure`, regardless of where it is in the `begin` clause.

### b.

|Version|`(p1 1)`|`(p2 1)`|
|---|---|---|
|Text|`'(1 2)`|`1`|
|Cy D Fect|`'(1 2)`|`(1 2)`|

Cy has discovered that an *unobservable reference* to an application passed in as an *argument* is treated as a variable lookup instead of a procedural application:

|Value|Observable?|Treated as|
|---|---|---|
|Application|Yes|Application|
|Application|No|Application|
|Argument|Yes|Application|
|**Argument**|**No**|**Variable**|

e.g.
```scheme
(define (p e)
  e ; Not forced
  x)
```


This is due to who evaluator is "lazy" with respect to: the *user*. If the user can't see the change, then it doesn't need to be evaluated.

This is why the only reference to `actual-value` outside of `eval` and `if` lies in the *driver loop*:

```scheme
(let ((input (read)))
  (let ((output
          (actual-value input the-global-environment))) ; Force every observable value
    (announce-output output-prompt)
    (user-print output)))
```

Cy can achieve his goal by simply wrapping his statement in no-argument `lambda`:

```scheme
(define (p2 x)
  (define (p e)
    (e)
    x)
  (p (lambda () (set! x (cons x '(2))))))
(p2 1) ; (1 2)
```

### c.

Cy's change is short-circuiting what would have occurred recursively through `eval` in the original version.

### d.

If lazy evaluation is supposed to change the order of evaluation and not the result, then the textbook implementation falls short of this.

Following newone at <http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-4.30>, we can satisfy Cy by simply adjusting the treatment of variable lookups in `eval`:

```scheme
((variable? exp) (force-it (lookup-variable-value exp env)))
```

This broadens the scope of what is considered to be "observed" by the user, ensuring that any referenced value is forced.
