## Question

Why does `flatten-stream` use `delay` explicitly? What would be wrong with defining it as follows:

```scheme
(define (flatten-stream stream)
  (if (stream-null? stream)
      the-empty-stream
      (interleave
       (stream-car stream)
       (flatten-stream (stream-cdr stream)))))
```

## Answer

Without `delay`, `flatten-stream` would recurse before calling `interleave`:

```scheme
(define (flatten-stream stream)
  (if (stream-null? stream)
      the-empty-stream
      (interleave-delayed
       (stream-car stream)
       (delay (flatten-stream (stream-cdr stream)))))) ; Delayed
```
