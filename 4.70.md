## Question

What is the purpose of the `let` bindings in the procedures `add-assertion!` and `add-rule!`? What would be wrong with the following implementation of `add-assertion!`? Hint: Recall the definition of the infinite stream of ones in section 3.5.2: `(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))`.

```scheme
(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (set! THE-ASSERTIONS
        (cons-stream assertion THE-ASSERTIONS))
  'ok)
```


## Answer

```scheme
(define (add-assertion! assertion)
  (store-assertion-in-index assertion)
  (let ((old-assertions THE-ASSERTIONS))
    (set! THE-ASSERTIONS
          (cons-stream assertion old-assertions))
    'ok))
```

The `let` clause retains a binding to the subsequent assertions.

Without it, `THE-ASSERTIONS` will recurse on the latest assertion:

```scheme
{'assertion 'asssertion 'assertion ...}
```
