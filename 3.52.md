## Question

Consider the sequence of expressions
```scheme
(define sum 0)
(define (accum x)
  (set! sum (+ x sum))
  sum)
(define seq (stream-map accum (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20)))
(define y (stream-filter even? seq))
(define z (stream-filter (lambda (x) (= (remainder x 5) 0))
                         seq))
(stream-ref y 7)
(display-stream z)
```

What is the value of sum after each of the above expressions is evaluated? What is the printed response to evaluating the `stream-ref` and `display-stream` expressions? Would these responses differ if we had implemented `(delay <exp>)` simply as `(lambda () <exp>)` without using the optimization provided by `memo-proc`? Explain.

## Answer

Value of sum:
```scheme
(define sum 0) ; sum: 0
(define (accum x)
  (set! sum (+ x sum))
  sum) ; sum: 0
(define seq (stream-map accum (stream-enumerate-interval 1 20))) ; sum: 1
(define y (stream-filter even? seq)) ; sum: 6
(define z (stream-filter (lambda (x) (= (remainder x 5) 0))
                         seq)) ; sum: 10
(stream-ref y 7) ; sum: 136
(display-stream z) ; sum: 210
```

Printed response:

```scheme
1 ]=> (stream-ref y 7)

;Value: 136

1 ]=> (display-stream z)

;; 10
;; 15
;; 45
;; 55
;; 105
;; 120
;; 190
;; 210
;Value: done
```

Memoization (call-by-need) ensures that `accum` only calculates each element of `seq` once. `y` and `z` trigger this calculation by traversing `seq` 2 and 5 units, respectively.

Not memoizing (call-by-name) would retrigger `accum` *each time* elements of `seq` are accessed. Any interaction with `y` or `z` cause this recalculation, mutating the value of each element in the stream.
