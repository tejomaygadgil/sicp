## Question

Suppose that (in ordinary applicative-order Scheme) we define `unless` as shown above and then define factorial in terms of `unless` as

```scheme
(define (unless condition usual-value exceptional-value)
  (if condition exceptional-value usual-value))
(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
          1))
```

What happens if we attempt to evaluate `(factorial 5)`? Will our definitions work in a normal-order language?

## Answer

Applicative-order `factorial` will infinitely recurse as it evaluates the arguments to `unless`:

```scheme
(factorial 5)
(unless false
        (* 5 (factorial 4))
        1)
(unless false
        (* 5
           (unless false
                   (* 4 (factorial 3))
                   1))
        1)
(unless false
        (* 5
           (unless false
                   (* 4
                      (unless false
                              (* 3 (factorial 2))
                              1))
                   1))
        1)
...
```

Normal-order `factorial` works because arguments are not evaluated until they are needed:

```scheme
(factorial 5)
(unless (= 5 1)
        (* 5 (factorial 4))
        1)
(if (= 5 1)
    1
    (* 5 (factorial 4)))
(if false
    1
    (* 5 (factorial 4)))
(* 5 (factorial 4)))
...
(* 5 (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 1))))
120
```
