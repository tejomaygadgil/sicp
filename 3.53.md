## Question

Without running the program, describe the elements of the stream defined by

```scheme
(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))
```

## Answer

`s` recursively defines geometric growth: `{1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 ...}`.

This is equivalent to `double` in the text:

```scheme
(define double (cons-stream 1 (scale-stream double 2)))
```
