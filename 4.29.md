# 4.29

## Question

Exhibit a program that you would expect to run much more slowly without memoization than with memoization. Also, consider the following interaction, where the `id` procedure is defined as in exercise 4.27 and count starts at 0:

```scheme
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

;;; L-Eval input:
(square (id 10))
;;; L-Eval value:
<response>

;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
<response>
```

Give the responses both when the evaluator memoizes and when it does not.

## Answer

```scheme
(define count 0)
(define (id x)
  (set! count (+ count 1))
  x)
```

|Memoized?|`(square (id 10))`|`count`|
|---|---|---|
|Yes|`100`|`1`|
|No|`100`|`2`|

Any program that refers to the same value will execute faster with memoization.

For instance, `fib`:

|Memoized?|`(fib (id 10))`|`count`|
|---|---|---|
|Yes|`55`|`1`|
|No|`55`|`320`|
