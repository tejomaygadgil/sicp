# 4.64

## Question

Louis Reasoner mistakenly deletes the `outranked-by` rule (section 4.4.1) from the data base. When he realizes this, he quickly reinstalls it. Unfortunately, he makes a slight change in the rule, and types it in as

```scheme
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
          (and (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
               (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager))))
```

Just after Louis types this information into the system, DeWitt Aull comes by to find out who outranks Ben Bitdiddle. He issues the query

```scheme
(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) ?who)
```

After answering, the system goes into an infinite loop. Explain why.

## Answer

```scheme
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
          (and (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager)
               (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss))))
```

Louis's procedure loops before specifying `?middle-manager`, recursing the original rule application:

```
Original application:
?staff-person: (Bitdiddle Ben)
?boss: ?who
---
Recursive application:
?staff-person: ?middle-manager = (Bitdiddle Ben) <-- Same as above!
?boss: ?who
```
