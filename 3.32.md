## Question

The procedures to be run during each time segment of the agenda are kept in a queue. Thus, the procedures for each segment are called in the order in which they were added to the agenda (first in, first out). Explain why this order must be used. In particular, trace the behavior of an and-gate whose inputs change from 0,1 to 1,0 in the same segment and say how the behavior would differ if we stored a segment's procedures in an ordinary list, adding and removing procedures only at the front (last in, first out).

## Answer

Single-threaded computer procedures cannot do two things at once. Therefore, we must abide by a *conventional sequence of events* to correctly model a simultaneous process.

In the digital circuit simulator, action procedures use the *current value* of each input wire to schedule the assignment of the output wire to `new-value`:

```scheme
(define (and-gate a1 a2 output)
  (define (and-action-procedure)
    (let ((new-value
            (logical-and (get-signal a1) ; Current value
                         (get-signal a2)))) ; Current value
      (after-delay and-gate-delay
                   (lambda ()
                     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! a1 and-action-procedure)
  (add-action! a2 and-action-procedure)
  'ok)
```

As wires are mutable, these actions must be executed in the order they were created -- first in, first out.

```
FIFO (queue)
[output: 0] [q: (a0: 0->1, a1: 1 ==> output: 1) (a1: 1->0, a0: 0 ==> output: 0)]
[output: 1] [q: (a1: 1->0, a0: 0 ==> output: 0)]
[output: 0] [q: ()] <-- Correct value
```
Last in, first out execution calculates things in reverse, misdirecting the evolution of simultaneous events.

```
LIFO (list)
[output: 0] [q: (a1: 1->0, a0: 0 ==> output: 0) (a0: 0->1, a1: 1 ==> output: 1)]
[output: 0] [q: (a0: 0->1, a1: 1 ==> output: 1)]
[output: 1] [q: ()] <-- Wrong value!
```
