## Question

`Eval` uses `actual-value` rather than `eval` to evaluate the operator before passing it to `apply`, in order to force the value of the operator. Give an example that demonstrates the need for this forcing.

## Answer

The lazy evaluator uses procedures to determine when to evaluate arguments. (Until then, all arguments remain as *thunks*, or representations of past action).

|Evaluator|Passing style|Meaning|Pseudo-code|
|---|---|---| ---|
|Lazy|Call-by-name|Representation of past action|`(list 'thunk <exp> <env>)`|
|Metacircular|Call-by-value|Result of past action|`(apply <exp> <env>)`|

Forcing every operator with `actual-value` ensures that every procedure is evaluated before receiving arguments. Otherwise, we can get into trouble when we pass procedures as arguments:

```scheme
(define (apply-proc-to-an-argument argument)
  (lambda (proc) (proc argument)))
(define (apply-proc-to-7 proc)
  ((apply-proc-to-an-agument 7) proc))
(apply-proc-to-7 square)
```

Without `actual-value`, `(apply-proc-to-an-argument 7)` would remain a thunk when it is applied to `square` on the last line.
