# 4.24

## Question

Design and carry out some experiments to compare the speed of the original metacircular evaluator with the version in this section. Use your results to estimate the fraction of time that is spent in analysis versus execution for various procedures.

## Answer

```scheme
(let test-if ((iterations 1e4))
  (if (= (modulo iterations 1e3) 0)
      (display "."))
  (if (= 0 iterations)
      (display "Done")
      (test-if (- iterations 1))))
```

|Evaluator|Time|
|---|---|
|Analyze|2.58 sec|
|Metacircular|4.97 sec|

Analyzing the procedure body using `sequentially` (cf. Ex 4.23) cuts the execution time in half.
