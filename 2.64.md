## Question

The following procedure `list->tree` converts an ordered list to a balanced binary tree. The helper procedure `partial-tree` takes as arguments an integer $n$ and list of at least $n$ elements and constructs a balanced tree containing the first $n$ elements of the list. The result returned by `partial-tree` is a pair (formed with `cons`) whose `car` is the constructed tree and whose `cdr` is the list of elements not included in the tree.

```scheme
(define (list->tree elements)
  (car (partial-tree elements (length elements))))

(define (partial-tree elts n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (cons '() elts)
      (let ((left-size (quotient (- n 1) 2)))
        (let ((left-result (partial-tree elts left-size)))
          (let ((left-tree (car left-result))
                (non-left-elts (cdr left-result))
                (right-size (- n (+ left-size 1))))
            (let ((this-entry (car non-left-elts))
                  (right-result (partial-tree (cdr non-left-elts)
                                              right-size)))
              (let ((right-tree (car right-result))
                    (remaining-elts (cdr right-result)))
                (cons (make-tree this-entry left-tree right-tree)
                      remaining-elts))))))))
```

 a. Write a short paragraph explaining as clearly as you can how `partial-tree` works. Draw the tree produced by `list->tree` for the list `(1 3 5 7 9 11)`.

b. What is the order of growth in the number of steps required by `list->tree` to convert a list of $n$ elements?

## Answer

### a.

```scheme
1 ]=> (list->tree '(1 3 5 7 9 11))

;Value: (5 (1 () (3 () ())) (9 (7 () ()) (11 () ())))
```

```mermaid

5 --> 1
1 --> none1["()"]
1 --> 3
3 --> none2["()"]
3 --> none3["()"]
5 --> 9
9 --> 7
7 --> none4["()"]
7 --> none5["()"]
9 --> 11
11 --> none6["()"]
11 --> none7["()"]
```

`partial-tree` recursively reduces tree generation by keeping track of remaining values `elts` and number of available nodes `n`.

When `n` is 0 `partial-tree` returns an empty tree along with `elts`.

Otherwise, `partial-tree` creates a balanced tree by from `elts` by using `n` to allocate slightly less than half of `elts` to the left branch, setting `this-entry` to next value, and passing the rest to `right-branch`. Pairing this sequence with monotonically reducing `n` down causes `partial-tree` to zig-zag as it hits the base case over and over. Splitting `elts` across branches ensures the tree is balanced all the way through.

### b.

`list->tree` is $O(n)$, applying constant time `cons` in each iteration across $n$ elements.
