# 2.24

## Question

Suppose we evaluate the expression `(list 1 (list 2 (list 3 4)))`. Give the result printed by the interpreter, the corresponding box-and-pointer structure, and the interpretation of this as a tree (as in figure 2.6).

## Answer

```scheme
(1 (2 (3 4)))
```

Box-and-pointer and tree diagrams share the same structure:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  1234("(1 (2 (3 4)))") --> 1
  1234 --> 234
  234("(2 (3 4))") --> 2
  234 --> 34
  34("(3 4)") --> 3
  34 --> 4
```
