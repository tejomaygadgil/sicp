## Question

Why do `disjoin` and `stream-flatmap` interleave the streams rather than simply append them? Give examples that illustrate why interleaving works better. (Hint: Why did we use `interleave` in section 3.5.3?)

## Answer

`interleave` handles infinitely long streams by providing a method to rotating across streams.
