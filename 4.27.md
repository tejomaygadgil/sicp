## Question

Suppose we type in the following definitions to the lazy evaluator:

```scheme
(define count 0)
(define (id x)
  (set! count (+ count 1))
  x)
```

Give the missing values in the following sequence of interactions, and explain your answers.

```scheme
(define w (id (id 10)))
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
<response>
;;; L-Eval input:
w
;;; L-Eval value:
<response>
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
<response>
```

## Answer

|Command|Response|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|`count`|`1`|`id` is applied to `(id 10)`, returning it as a thunk.|
|`w`|`10`|`(id 10)` is forced, also setting `count` to 2.|
|`count`|`2`|Both `id`s have been evaluated.|
