# 4.46

## Question

The evaluators in sections 4.1 and 4.2 do not determine what order operands are evaluated in. We will see that the amb evaluator evaluates them from left to right. Explain why our parsing program wouldn't work if the operands were evaluated in some other order.

## Answer

The grammar parser processes nouns followed by verbs:

```scheme
(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
        (parse-noun-phrase) ; Nouns
        (parse-verb-phrase))) ; Verbs
```

Non-left-to-right evaluation would disrupt this ordering:

```scheme
(define (parse-word word-list)
  (require (not (null? *unparsed*)))
  (require (memq (car *unparsed*) (cdr word-list))) ; Won't work
  (let ((found-word (car *unparsed*)))
    (set! *unparsed* (cdr *unparsed*))
    (list (car word-list) found-word)))
```
