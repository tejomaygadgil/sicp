## Question

Louis Reasoner thinks that building a stream of pairs from three parts is unnecessarily complicated. Instead of separating the pair $(S_0,T_0)$ from the rest of the pairs in the first row, he proposes to work with the whole first row, as follows:

```scheme
(define (pairs s t)
  (interleave
   (stream-map (lambda (x) (list (stream-car s) x))
               t)
   (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t))))
```

Does this work? Consider what happens if we evaluate `(pairs integers integers)` using Louis's definition of pairs.

## Answer

Louis's code triggers an infinite recursion. `interleave` is not a special form, so `(pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t))` evaluates to itself before `interleave` can alternative it with `stream-map`.

The original `pairs` avoids this by nesting `interleave` inside the promise of its stream:

```scheme
(define (pairs s t)
  (cons-stream
   (list (stream-car s) (stream-car t))
   (interleave
    (stream-map (lambda (x) (list (stream-car s) x))
                (stream-cdr t))
    (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t)))))
```
