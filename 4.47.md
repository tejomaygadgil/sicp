## Question

Louis Reasoner suggests that, since a verb phrase is either a verb or a verb phrase followed by a prepositional phrase, it would be much more straightforward to define the procedure `parse-verb-phrase` as follows (and similarly for noun phrases):

```scheme
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb (parse-word verbs)
       (list 'verb-phrase
             (parse-verb-phrase)
             (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
```

Does this work? Does the program's behavior change if we interchange the order of expressions in the `amb`?

## Answer

Louis's procedure will infinitely recurse on the call to `(parse-verb-phrase)` on line 4.

The textbook procedure avoids this by `amb`ing a checkpoint instead of the entire phrase:

```scheme
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend verb-phrase)
    (amb verb-phrase
         (maybe-extend (list 'verb-phrase
                             verb-phrase
                             (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-word verbs)))
```

Interchanging the expressions makes matters worse by recursing before returning any results.
