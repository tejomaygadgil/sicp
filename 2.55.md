## Question

Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression

```scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

To her surprise, the interpreter prints back quote. Explain.

## Answer

As footnote 34 explains, `'` is shorthand for applying the `quote` operator to the next well-formed expression, which in this case is `'abracadabra`. The same logic applies, yielding `(quote (quote abracadabra))`.

The first `quote` freezes its contents, returning `(quote abracadabra)` as a list instead of evaluating it.

The first element of this list is `quote`, which is precisely what `car` returns to Eva.
