## Question

Give an interpretation of the stream computed by the following procedure:

```scheme
(define (expand num den radix)
  (cons-stream
   (quotient (* num radix) den)
   (expand (remainder (* num radix) den) den radix)))
```

(Quotient is a primitive that returns the integer quotient of two integers.) What are the successive elements produced by `(expand 1 7 10)`? What is produced by `(expand 3 8 10)`?

## Answer

`expand` computes the division of numerator `num` by denominator `dem` in the numeral base is given by `radix`. (For instance, `(expand <num> <den> 10)` computes ordinary decimal division, while `(expand <num> <den> 2)` computes binary division.)

|Command|Result|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|`(expand 1 7 10)`|`{1 4 2 8 5 6 ...}`|$1 / 7 = 1.42856\dots$|
|`(expand 3 8 10)`|`{3 7 5 0 0 0 ...}`|$3 / 8 = 3.75$|
