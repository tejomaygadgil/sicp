## Question

As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects or new operations may be needed. For each of the three strategies -- generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add new types or new operations. Which organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? Which would be most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

## Answer

| Method | Adding operations | Adding types |
|---|---|---|
| Explicit dispatch | New procedure | Modify procedure |
| Message-passing | Modify constructor | New constructor |
| Data-directed | New package | New package |

Systems needing new types benefit most from **message-passing** or **data-directed programming**.

On the other hand, systems requiring new operations should use **explicit dispatching**.

Data-directed programming is unique in that it is additive for new types and operations. However, this comes at the cost of non-localized code, as any package can potentially install anything.
