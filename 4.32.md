# 4.32

## Question

Give some examples that illustrate the difference between the streams of chapter 3 and the "lazier" lazy lists described in this section. How can you take advantage of this extra laziness?

## Answer

Full-lazy evaluation lets us create data structures that do not evolve linearly (`car` followed by `cdr`, etc.).

Some examples include

* A "lazy tree" that evaluates nodes as they are traversed,
* The simultaneous definition internal block problem of section 4.1.6,
* Evolving structures such as differential equations.
