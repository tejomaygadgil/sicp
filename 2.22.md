# 2.22

## Question

Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first `square-list` procedure of exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items nil))
```

Unfortunately, defining `square-list` this way produces the answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?

Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to `cons`:

```scheme
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square (car things))))))
  (iter items nil))
```

This doesn't work either. Explain.

# Answer

`(cons (square (car things)) answer)` places the subsequent answer before the predecessor, resulting in a reversed list.

The second attempt uses the right order but leads with `nil`: this should be a base case instead.
