# 3.34

## Question

Louis Reasoner wants to build a squarer, a constraint device with two terminals such that the value of connector b on the second terminal will always be the square of the value a on the first terminal. He proposes the following simple device made from a multiplier:

```scheme
(define (squarer a b)
  (multiplier a a b))
```

There is a serious flaw in this idea. Explain.

## Answer

Louis's idea is sensible: pass `a` twice to indicate the same *number* being multiplied, not two numbers with the same *value*. This approach addresses Lem's complaint about the Interval Arithmetic system (Ex 2.14 - 2.16), and makes use of the discussion of maintaining identity under assignment (section 3.1.3).

The problem is that `multiplier` is designed to handle identity in *values*, not *numbers*. The procedure cannot leverage the fact that `m1` is the same number as `m2`. Consequently setting `a` will compute `b` but not vice-versa.

This can be addressed by adding a new case to `process-new-value` in `multiplier`:

```scheme
  (define (process-new-value)
    (cond ...
          ((and (has-value? product)  ; Only have product?
                (equal? m1 m2) ; Multiplier equals multiplicand?
                (not (has-value? m1))) ; Multiplier / multiplicand empty?
             (set-value! m1
                         (sqrt (get-value product))
                         me))))
```

This approach works, but requires `multiplier` to manage every other issue related to identity under assignment. Ben is better off developing `squarer` from scratch.
