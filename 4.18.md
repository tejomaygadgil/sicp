## Question

Consider an alternative strategy for scanning out definitions that translates the example in the text to

```scheme
(lambda <vars>
  (let ((u '*unassigned*)
        (v '*unassigned*))
    (let ((a <e1>)
          (b <e2>))
      (set! u a)
      (set! v b))
    <e3>))
```

Here `a` and `b` are meant to represent new variable names, created by the interpreter, that do not appear in the user's program. Consider the `solve` procedure from section 3.5.4:

```scheme
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
  (define dy (stream-map f y))
  y)
```

Will this procedure work if internal definitions are scanned out as shown in this exercise? What if they are scanned out as shown in the text? Explain.

## Answer

* The alternative strategy will error out defining `b`[^1]:
    ```scheme
    (define (solve f y0 dt)
      (let ((y *unassigned*)
            (dy *unassigned*))
        (let ((a (integral (delay dy) y0 dt)) ; `dy` is not evaluated
              (b (stream-map f y))) ; Error: `y` is *unassigned*
          (set! y a)
          (set! dy b)
        y)))
    ```

* The text scanner strategy will work due to `delay`:
    ```scheme
    (define (solve f y0 dt)
      (let ((y *unassigned*)
            (dy *unassigned*))
        (set! y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt)) ; `dy` is not evaluated
        (set! dy (stream-map f y)))) ; Success: `y` is set
    ```
