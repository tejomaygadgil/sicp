# 3.63

## Question

Louis Reasoner asks why the `sqrt-stream` procedure was not written in the following more straightforward way, without the local variable `guesses`:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-stream x)
  (cons-stream 1.0
               (stream-map (lambda (guess)
                             (sqrt-improve guess x))
                           (sqrt-stream x))))
```

Alyssa P. Hacker replies that this version of the procedure is considerably less efficient because it performs redundant computation. Explain Alyssa's answer. Would the two versions still differ in efficiency if our implementation of `delay` used only `(lambda () <exp>)` without using the optimization provided by `memo-proc` (section 3.5.1)?

## Answer

Alyssa has observed that representing streams as *procedures* causes recalculation upon recursion, whereas representing streams as *data* (local variable `guesses`, for instance) enables lookup of the previous value[^1].

The two versions would behave the same without `memo-proc` (call-by-name passing) because the data representation's lookup value would have to be recalculated.
