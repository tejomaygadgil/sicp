## Question

Ben Bitdiddle and Alyssa P. Hacker disagree over the importance of lazy evaluation for implementing things such as `unless`. Ben points out that it's possible to implement `unless` in applicative order as a special form. Alyssa counters that, if one did that, `unless` would be merely syntax, not a procedure that could be used in conjunction with higher-order procedures. Fill in the details on both sides of the argument. Show how to implement `unless` as a derived expression (like `cond` or `let`), and give an example of a situation where it might be useful to have `unless` available as a procedure, rather than as a special form.

## Answer

Ben is correct: like `if` and `cons-stream`, a special-form `unless` would change the order of evalution of its arguments.

As Alyssa points out, this comes at a cost that `unless` can only be an operator and never an operand.

That said, it is hard to think of a procedural use of `unless` as most programs (including the ones in this text) are written without first-class access to the conditional.
