# 3.13

## Question

Consider the following `make-cycle` procedure, which uses the `last-pair` procedure defined in exercise 3.12:

```scheme
(define (make-cycle x)
  (set-cdr! (last-pair x) x)
  x)
```

Draw a box-and-pointer diagram that shows the structure `z` created by

```scheme
(define z (make-cycle (list 'a 'b 'c)))
```

What happens if we try to compute `(last-pair z)`?

## Answer

`(last-pair z)` cycles forever:
