## Question

The internal procedure `accept-action-procedure!` defined in `make-wire` specifies that when a new action procedure is added to a wire, the procedure is immediately run. Explain why this initialization is necessary. In particular, trace through the half-adder example in the paragraphs above and say how the system's response would differ if we had defined `accept-action-procedure!` as

```scheme
(define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
  (set! action-procedures (cons proc action-procedures)))
```

## Answer

Calling `proc` acts like an intial jolt to enforce relations among wires.

Without it, wire E in the half-adder does not get correctly get initialized to 1:

This causes S to remain 0 when we set wire A to 1 because the and-gate of D and E fails to lights up.
