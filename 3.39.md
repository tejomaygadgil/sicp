## Question

Which of the five possibilities in the parallel execution shown above remain if we instead serialize execution as follows:

```scheme
(define x 10)

(define s (make-serializer))

(parallel-execute (lambda () (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
                  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
```

## Answer

Compared to the text, the question only serializes the *squaring* of the first procedure.

We can enumerate the possibilities by breaking each procedure into two parts (a) `*/+` and (b) `set!` and filtering the permutations for two conditions:

1. (a) must precede (b) for each procedure, and
2. `p1a` cannot occur in between `p2a` and `p2b`:

```
p1a p1b p2a p2b --> (100), 100, (100), 101
p1a p2a p1b p2b --> (100), (11), 100, 11
p1a p2a p2b p1b --> (100), (11), 11, 100
p2a p2b p1a p1b --> (11), 11, (121), 121
```

4 out of 5 possibilities are possible:

Value | Description | Occurs?
---|---|---
101 | $P_1$ sets `x` to 100 and then $P_2$ increments `x` to 101. | Yes
121 | $P_2$ increments `x` to 11 and then $P_1$ sets `x` to `x` times `x`. | Yes
110 | $P_2$ changes `x` from 10 to 11 between the two times that $P_1$ accesses the value of `x` during the evaluation of `(* x x)`. | No -- `(* x x)` is serialized!
11 | $P_2$ accesses `x`, then $P_1$ sets `x` to 100, then $P_2$ sets `x`. | Yes
100 | $P_1$ accesses `x` (twice), then $P_2$ sets `x` to 11, then $P_1$ sets `x`. |  Yes
