## Question

Suppose we define x and y to be two lists:

```scheme
(define x (list 1 2 3))
(define y (list 4 5 6))
```

What result is printed by the interpreter in response to evaluating each of the following expressions:

```scheme
(append x y)

(cons x y)

(list x y)
```

## Answer

```scheme
(1 2 3 4 5 6) ; (append x y)

((1 2 3) . (4 5 6)) ; (cons x y)

((1 2 3) (4 5 6) ; (list x y)
```
