# 3.46

## Question

Suppose that we implement `test-and-set!` using an ordinary procedure as shown in the text, without attempting to make the operation atomic. Draw a timing diagram like the one in figure 3.29 to demonstrate how the mutex implementation can fail by allowing two processes to acquire the mutex at the same time.
