## Question

Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difficult.)

## Answer

Identifying equivalent expressions requires some notion of reflexivity:

$$\forall x.(x \in X \implies (x, x) \in R)$$

Our interval arithmetic implementation lacks a concept of identity that would enable it to return `(1 . 1)` for operations such as `(div-interval a a)`.

Including an `id` field in `make-interval` would fix basic calculations but not the problem that Lem found. 

For that, expressions would have to be syntactically refactored upon submission, or analyzed by a parser to track variable use across an expression.

Another option would be using Monte Carlo methods to simulate many draws from a uniform distribution to calculate a statistic (sample mean) of the distribution of the resulting random variable.
