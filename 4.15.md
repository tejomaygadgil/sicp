## Question

Given a one-argument procedure `p` and an object `a`, `p` is said to "halt" on a if evaluating the expression `(p a)` returns a value (as opposed to terminating with an error message or running forever). Show that it is impossible to write a procedure `halts?` that correctly determines whether `p` halts on `a` for any procedure `p` and object `a`. Use the following reasoning: If you had such a procedure `halts?`, you could implement the following program:

```scheme
(define (run-forever) (run-forever))

(define (try p)
  (if (halts? p p)
      (run-forever)
      'halted))
```

Now consider evaluating the expression `(try try)` and show that any possible outcome (either halting or running forever) violates the intended behavior of `halts?`.

## Answer

For a proof by contradiction, assume `halt?` exists.

Observe how `try` does the opposite of `(p p)`:

If `(p p)` halts, `try` will run forever. If `(p p)` runs forever, `try` will halt.

`(try try)` yields a contradiction:

* If `(halts? try try)` is true, `(try try)` runs forever.
* If `(halts? try try)` is false, `(try try)` will halt.

Therefore `halts?` cannot exist.
